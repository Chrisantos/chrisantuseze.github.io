Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research sits at the intersection of software engineering, security and cyber-physical systems. I work to improve the security and safety of embedded systems, through well-engineered software.

## Personal
